# Customer_Churn-Analysis

## Project Description
This repository contains the Exploratory Data analysis and visualization of various charts and graphs created during EDA. This exploratory data analysis (EDA) investigates patterns and drivers of customer churn in a telecom dataset, focusing on service usage, customer demographics, and billing information. The visual and statistical insights aim to support strategic retention decisions.

## Project Objectives
- Identify Key Drivers of Customer Churn: Analyze customer attributes to pinpoint the most significant factors contributing to churn behavior.
- Segment High-Risk Customer Groups: Classify customer segments with elevated churn risk for targeted interventions.
- Evaluate Impact of Service Features on Retention: Assess how optional services influence customer loyalty and develop recommendations for bundling.
- Develop Data-Driven Retention Strategies: Use insights from the analysis to recommend actionable strategies, such as bundling offers, loyalty rewards, or personalized plans, to reduce churn.
- Visualize Customer Behavior Patterns: Create intuitive visual dashboards that highlight churn trends across service categories, payment methods, tenure, and customer demographics for stakeholder understanding.
- Support Predictive Modeling for Churn: Prepare the groundwork for machine learning models by identifying and engineering features with high predictive value.
- Quantify Financial Risk Due to Churn: Estimate the revenue impact of churned customers (based on monthly charges and tenure) to help prioritize high-value customer retention.

## Key Project Insights
1.	Overall Churn Rate: Approximately 26.5% of customers have churned.
2.	Customer Tenure: Nearly 50% of churned customers had a tenure of less than 12 months, indicating early-stage churn vulnerability.
3.	Contract Type: Month-to-month contract customers represent over 85% of churned users, in contrast, customers on two-year contracts show significantly lower churn (<5%).
4.	Payment Methods: Electronic check users contribute to around 45% of total churn, while automatic payment methods like credit cards are associated with better retention.
5.	Senior Citizens: 42% of senior citizens churned, compared to 22% of non-senior citizens, making them a high-risk group.
6.	Monthly Charges: Customers paying more than $70 per month churn at a rate of over 35%, especially those without bundled or value-added services.
7.	Value-Added Services: Churn is higher among those without services like- Tech Support (Churn rate: ~38%), Online Security (Churn rate: ~41%), Device Protection (Churn rate: ~36%)
8.	Internet and Streaming Services: Customers using Fiber optic internet churn significantly more (~37%) than DSL users (~20%).
9.	Partner & Dependents: Customers without a partner or dependents show a churn rate of over 32%, compared to 18% among those with dependents, indicating family-linked customers are more loyal.

## Strategic Insights
•	Retention Focus: Target month-to-month, high-charge, and service-light customers with incentives, bundles, or loyalty programs.
•	Feature Upsell: Promote Tech Support and Security services to reduce churn in high-risk segments.
•	Senior Citizen Strategy: Offer specialized plans and support to improve retention among elderly customers.
